## Running Locally

To run the application locally and access it in your browser, first set the PORT environment variable to the value of your choice. An example is shown below.
```
export PORT=3000
After the PORT environment variable has been set, run the Node.js application with the command below.
```

```
node server.js
```
The application will now be running locally on PORT, in this case that is port 3000. You can then access it locally from your browser at the URL localhost:PORT, in this case localhost:3000.


## Future Additions

The appearance could use some texture, also it would be fun to add google fonts.
